# Deep-Memes-sillycam-algo-

## Description:
  A python code, using deep learning, tensorflow, deep fakes and contains a flask API. Will take in an image of a face and a video_ID. Will generate
  a video with the face morphed within the video character's face. This was built by me, to be used with an app Silly-Cam. You can find it's repository 
  in my github account pins. 
  -> This file was then uploaded into google cloud and was connected with the app. Althought it was used with the app, this provied an independent API
  and can be used with any web-app, desktop-app, or smartphone app.
  -> This was optimiezed by me, initially it took 20 min to generate a 19 sec video but upon optimization and engaging GPU it took around 30-50 seconds.
  -> This algorithm, helped us win the International Silly Hacks Competition.
